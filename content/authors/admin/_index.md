My research interests are in the areas of <b>machine learning</b> and <b>discrete optimization</b>.</p>
    <p>In particular, my goal is to <b>improve discrete optimization solvers and algorithms by using machine learning</b>.</p><p>Recently, I have been also working on <b>discrete problems that arise in deep learning</b>, where continuous optimization methods fail and combinatorial algorithms are more natural.</p>
		<!-- <p>Particularly, I work on theoretical foundations and scalable algorithms for stochastic processes on networks.</p> -->
		<p>I did my Ph.D. in <a href="http://cse.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Computational Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, where I worked with <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bdilkina" target="_blank">Bistra Dilkina</a>, and collaborated closely with <a href="http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~gnemhaus/" target="_blank">George Nemhauser</a>.</p>
