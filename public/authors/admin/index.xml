      <description>My research interests are in the areas of machine learning and discrete optimization.
In particular, my goal is to improve discrete optimization solvers and algorithms by using machine learning.
Recently, I have been also working on discrete problems that arise in deep learning, where continuous optimization methods fail and combinatorial algorithms are more natural.
Particularly, I work on theoretical foundations and scalable algorithms for stochastic processes on networks.
